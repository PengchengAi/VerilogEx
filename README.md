# Verilog Exercises

## Introduction

Verilog exercises for the 2017 Electronics Design Contest.

## Requirement

You need an EDA platform (Quartus for Altera FPGA or ISE/Vivado for Xilinx FPGA), or Modelsim at least.

## How to use

In the `questions` directory, you can see 6 exercises. The exercises are ordered by their levels of difficulty.
In each Exercise, you can see a main verilog file and a testbench. You must fill in the blanks indicated in the
main verilog file. Then, you can run it with the testbench. The testbench will tell you if your code works well.

In the `answers` directory, I provide the answers to the questions. **It will be uploaded later.**
